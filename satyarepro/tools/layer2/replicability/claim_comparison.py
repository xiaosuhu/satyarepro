_JUDGE_PROMPT = """\
Target claim:
\"\"\"
{target_claim}
\"\"\"

Candidate paper title:
\"\"\"
{title}
\"\"\"

Candidate paper snippet:
\"\"\"
{snippet}
\"\"\"

Do the following, in order:

1. Determine "population_modality": what population and what input modality/data type \
the candidate paper studies. Base this primarily on the snippet text; the title may be \
used as auxiliary context but is not sufficient on its own if the snippet doesn't support \
it. If the snippet gives no information at all about population/modality, say so \
explicitly rather than guessing from the title alone.

2. Extract "extracted_claim": the directional claim the candidate paper makes that is \
comparable to the target claim. If the snippet does not contain a directional claim (e.g. \
it only mentions the same topic or dataset without stating an effect, direction, or \
outcome), leave this as an empty string "" — do not force a claim into existence.

3. Determine "comparison_type":
- "direct": same population + same modality, testing the same underlying claim as the \
target claim.
- "conceptual": different population or modality, but testing the same underlying claim \
(the comparison is still meaningful, just not a literal replication).
- "not_comparable": the candidate is not actually testing the same underlying claim at \
all (e.g. same general topic/dataset, but a different research question).

4. Determine "agreement" — but ONLY if extracted_claim is non-empty AND comparison_type \
is not "not_comparable". If extracted_claim is empty, agreement MUST be \
"no_comparable_evidence" regardless of what comparison_type was determined to be. The \
agreement categories:
- "agree": both claims are directionally consistent with no meaningful qualification.
- "partially_agree": both claims have a stated direction, but with a meaningful \
qualification or partial divergence (e.g. consistent in one subgroup but not another, \
same direction but different significance/robustness caveats noted by the candidate's own \
authors).
- "conflict": the candidate's directional claim contradicts the target claim.
- "no_comparable_evidence": no directional claim could be extracted from the snippet \
(comparison_type may still be direct/conceptual — e.g. same population/modality, but the \
retrieved snippet just doesn't happen to cover the outcome direction).

Calibration examples for the partially_agree vs. no_comparable_evidence boundary:
- "mentions the same oversampling approach was tried on a similar dataset, no effect \
direction stated" -> no_comparable_evidence (no direction was ever stated).
- "reports improved recall in one subgroup but not another" -> partially_agree (a \
direction is stated, but with a qualification).
- "reports the same direction of effect as the target claim but notes it was not \
statistically significant" -> partially_agree (direction stated, with a caveat).

5. Provide "evidence": a short quote or paraphrase from the snippet supporting the \
comparison_type + agreement determination.

6. Provide "confidence": "high", "medium", or "low", reflecting how much the judgment is \
limited by the snippet being a short excerpt rather than the full paper.
